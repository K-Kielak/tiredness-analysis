	abstract = {Driving characteristics of lane departure can provide design principles for lane departure warning system and lane keeping assist system. In this article, based on driving simulator experiments of unintentional lane departure, the operation performances of human drivers, the motion characteristics of vehicles, and the relative motion between the vehicle and lane line are synthetically studied. First, unintentional lane departure is classified into lane departure by fatigue and lane departure by secondary task. Subsequently, two simulator experiments of fatigue-based lane departure and secondary task–based are designed and performed to collect the synchronous driver–vehicle–road data. The data of steering angle, steering angle velocity, steering angle entropy, lateral acceleration, lateral velocity, and yaw velocity, under fatigue-based and secondary task–based lane departure are collected and compared with those gathered under normal lane changing. Results show that the characteristics of unintentional lane departures differ from that of normal lane departure changing. Furthermore, the characteristics of fatigue-based lane departures are shown some differences with that of secondary task–based ones.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate commercially available devices for driver fatigue monitoring with particular focus on the needs of the mining industry. We present an overview of fatigue monitoring technologies (FMTs) and propose means to evaluate the devices. Three video-based devices were selected and used in an overnight driving simulation study to test their accuracy. In total 14 healthy volunteers performed the driving simulation tasks in eight test runs separated by breaks of approximately 10 min. EEG and EOG were recorded during the driving periods. The output variable of the FMT devices (percentage of eye closures, PERCLOS), subjectively rated fatigue on the Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS), and driving performance in terms of standard deviation of lateral position in lane (SDL) were also recorded throughout testing sessions. Regression analysis revealed that PERCLOS is significantly related to higher KSS scores and to SDL. Calculations at a finer temporal resolution as well as on an intra-subject level showed decreased correlation coefficients. Discriminant analysis of PERCLOS and EEG/EOG suggested that PERCLOS does not differentiate well between mild and strong fatigue. The results suggest that under laboratory conditions current FMT devices are reliable when temporal resolution is not too fine ({\textgreater}30 min) and data averaged across several subjects is utilized, but fail to give a valid prediction of subjective fatigue as well as of driving performance on an individual level.},

Twenty-four licensed drivers diagnosed with OSAS based on standard clinical and polysomnographic criteria, participated in an hour-long drive in a high-fidelity driving simulator with synchronous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings for identification of microsleeps. The drivers showed significant deterioration in vehicle control during the microsleep episodes compared to driving performance in the absence of microsleeps on equivalent segments of roadway. The degree of performance decrement correlated with microsleep duration, particularly on curved roads. Results indicate that driving performance deteriorates during microsleep episodes. Detecting microsleeps in real-time and identifying how these episodes of transition between wakefulness and sleep impair driver performance is relevant to the design and implementation of countermeasures such as drowsy driver detection and alerting systems that use EEG technology.},

In this paper, we summarize these approaches by dividing them into the following five different types of measures: 1) subjective report measures; 2) driver biological measures; 3) driver physical measures; 4) driving performance measures; and 5) hybrid measures. Among these approaches, subjective report measures and driver biological measures are not suitable under real driving conditions but could serve as some rough ground-truth indicators. The hybrid measures are believed to give more reliable solutions compared with single driver physical measures or driving performance measures, because the hybrid measures minimize the number of false alarms and maintain a high recognition rate, which promote the acceptance of the system. We also discuss some nonlinear modeling techniques commonly used in the literature.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives:
Drowsiness is a major risk factor for motor vehicle and occupational accidents. Real-time objective indicators of drowsiness could potentially identify drowsy individuals with the goal of intervening before an accident occurs. Several ocular measures are promising objective indicators of drowsiness; however, there is a lack of studies evaluating their accuracy for detecting behavioral impairment due to drowsiness in real time.

Methods:
In this study, eye movement parameters were measured during vigilance tasks following restricted sleep and in a rested state (n = 33 participants) at three testing points (n = 71 data points) to compare ocular measures to a gold standard measure of drowsiness (OSLER). The utility of these parameters for detecting drowsiness-related errors was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) (adjusted by clustering for participant) and identification of optimal cutoff levels for identifying frequent drowsiness-related errors (4 missed signals in a minute using OSLER). Their accuracy was tested for detecting increasing frequencies of behavioral lapses on a different task (psychomotor vigilance task [PVT]).

Results:
Ocular variables which measured the average duration of eyelid closure (inter-event duration [IED]) and the ratio of the amplitude to velocity of eyelid closure were reliable indicators of frequent errors (area under the curve for ROC of 0.73 to 0.83, p {\textless} 0.05). IED produced a sensitivity and specificity of 71\% and 88\% for detecting ≥ 3 lapses (PVT) in a minute and 100\% and 86\% for ≥ 5 lapses. A composite measure of several eye movement characteristics (Johns Drowsiness Scale) provided sensitivities of 77\% and 100\% for detecting 3 and ≥ 5 lapses in a minute, with specificities of 85\% and 83\%, respectively.

Conclusions:
Ocular measures, particularly those measuring the average duration of episodes of eye closure are promising real-time indicators of drowsiness.

Abnormal eye behavior, steering wheel activity, and vehicle trajectory during different drowsiness stages were studied in detail to overcome the limitations of single-sensor approaches. Some measures, such as percentage of eyelid closure, maximum close duration, and percentage of nonsteering were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods. Moreover, a two-stage data fusion framework was developed for the modeling combination of information from different sources. Fisher's linear discriminant was implied as the feature-level fusion method, and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory was introduced in the decision-level fusion process.

Five male and five female shift workers were recruited to participate in a 2-h drive (08:00-10:00 hours) after a normal night sleep and after working a night shift. Subjective sleepiness was rated on the KSS in 5-min intervals during the drive, electro-occulogram (EOG) was measured continuously to calculate BLINKD, and SDLAT was collected from the simulator. A mixed model anova showed a significant (P {\textless} 0.001) effect of the KSS for both dependent variables. A test for a quadratic trend suggests a curvilinear effect with a steeper increase at high KSS levels for both SDLAT (P {\textless} 0.001) and BLINKD (P = 0.003). Large individual differences were observed for the intercept (P {\textless} 0.001), suggesting that subjects differed in their overall driving performance and blink duration independent of sleepiness levels. The results have implications for any application that needs prediction at the subject level (e.g. driver fatigue warning systems) as well as for research design and the interpretation of group average data.},

	abstract = {Previous research on driver drowsiness detection has focused primarily on lane deviation metrics and high levels of fatigue. The present research sought to develop a method for detecting driver drowsiness at more moderate levels of fatigue, well before accident risk is imminent. Eighty-seven different driver drowsiness detection metrics proposed in the literature were evaluated in two simulated shift work studies with high-fidelity simulator driving in a controlled laboratory environment. Twenty-nine participants were subjected to a night shift condition, which resulted in moderate levels of fatigue; 12 participants were in a day shift condition, which served as control. Ten simulated work days in the study design each included four 30-min driving sessions, during which participants drove a standardized scenario of rural highways. Ten straight and uneventful road segments in each driving session were designated to extract the 87 different driving metrics being evaluated. The dimensionality of the overall data set across all participants, all driving sessions and all road segments was reduced with principal component analysis, which revealed that there were two dominant dimensions: measures of steering wheel variability and measures of lateral lane position variability. The latter correlated most with an independent measure of fatigue, namely performance on a psychomotor vigilance test administered prior to each drive. We replicated our findings across eight curved road segments used for validation in each driving session. Furthermore, we showed that lateral lane position variability could be derived from measured changes in steering wheel angle through a transfer function, reflecting how steering wheel movements change vehicle heading in accordance with the forces acting on the vehicle and the road. This is important given that traditional video-based lane tracking technology is prone to data loss when lane markers are missing, when weather conditions are bad, or in darkness. Our research findings indicated that steering wheel variability provides a basis for developing a cost-effective and easy-to-install alternative technology for in-vehicle driver drowsiness detection at moderate levels of fatigue.},

Fifty-six male subjects each drove during two different 40-min periods. In one case, roadside visual stimuli were essentially repetitive and monotonous, while in the other one, the environment contained disparate visual elements aiming to disrupt monotony without changing road geometry. Subject's driving performance was compared across these conditions in order to determine whether disruptions of monotony can have a positive effect and help alleviate driver fatigue. Results reveal an early time-on-task effect on driving performance for both driving periods and more frequent large SWM when driving in the more monotonous road environment, which implies greater fatigue and vigilance decrements.

Twenty-two healthy male subjects (age = 21.5 +/- 2 years; distance driven per year = 12,225 +/- 4739 km (7641 +/- 2962 miles) [mean +/- S.D.]) drove 1000 km (625 miles) over 10 h during five 105 min sessions on an open highway. Self-rated fatigue and sleepiness before each session, number of inappropriate line crossings from video recordings and simple reaction time (RT) were measured. Total crossings increased after sleep restriction (535 crossings in the sleep-restricted condition versus 66 after non-restricted sleep (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 8.1; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 3.2-20.5; p {\textless} 0.001)), from the first driving session. The interaction between the two factors (conditionxtime of day) was also significant (F(5, 105) = 3.229; p {\textless} 0.05). Increasing sleepiness score was associated with increasing crossings during the next driving session in the sleep-restricted (IRR: 1.9; 95\% CI: 1.4-2.4) but not in the non-restricted condition (IRR: 1.0; 95\% CI: 0.8-1.3). Increasing self-perceived fatigue was not associated with increasing crossings in either condition (IRR: 0.95; 95\% CI: 0.93-0.98 and IRR: 1.0; 95\% CI: 0.98-1.02). Rested subjects drove 1000 km with four shorts breaks with only a minor performance decrease. Sleep restriction induced important performance degradation even though time awake (8h) and session driving times (105 min) were relatively short. Major inter-individual differences were observed under sleep restriction. Performance degradation was associated with sleepiness and not fatigue. Sleepiness combined with fatigue significantly affected RT. Road safety campaigns should encourage drivers to avoid driving after sleep restriction, even on relatively short trips especially if they feel sleepy.},

	abstract = {In recent years, driver drowsiness has been one of the major causes of road accidents and can lead to severe physical injuries, deaths and significant economic losses. Statistics indicate the need of a reliable driver drowsiness detection system which could alert the driver before a mishap happens. Researchers have attempted to determine driver drowsiness using the following measures: (1) vehicle-based measures; (2) behavioral measures and (3) physiological measures. A detailed review on these measures will provide insight on the present systems, issues associated with them and the enhancements that need to be done to make a robust system. In this paper, we review these three measures as to the sensors used and discuss the advantages and limitations of each. The various ways through which drowsiness has been experimentally manipulated is also discussed. We conclude that by designing a hybrid drowsiness detection system that combines non-intusive physiological measures with other measures one would accurately determine the drowsiness level of a driver. A number of road accidents might then be avoided if an alert is sent to a driver that is deemed drowsy.},

	abstract = {EEG-microstates exploit spatio-temporal EEG features to characterize the spontaneous EEG as a sequence of a finite number of quasi-stable scalp potential field maps. So far, EEG-microstates have been studied mainly in wakeful rest and are thought to correspond to functionally relevant brain-states. Four typical microstate maps have been identified and labeled arbitrarily with the letters A, B, C and D. We addressed the question whether EEG-microstate features are altered in different stages of NREM sleep compared to wakefulness. 32-channel EEG of 32 subjects in relaxed wakefulness and NREM sleep was analyzed using a clustering algorithm, identifying the most dominant amplitude topography maps typical of each vigilance state. Fitting back these maps into the sleep-scored EEG resulted in a temporal sequence of maps for each sleep stage. All 32 subjects reached sleep stage N2, 19 also N3, for at least 1min and 45s. As in wakeful rest we found four microstate maps to be optimal in all NREM sleep stages. The wake maps were highly similar to those described in the literature for wakefulness. The sleep stage specific map topographies of N1 and N3 sleep showed a variable but overall relatively high degree of spatial correlation to the wake maps (Mean: N1 92\%; N3 87\%). The N2 maps were the least similar to wake (mean: 83\%). Mean duration, total time covered, global explained variance and transition probabilities per subject, map and sleep stage were very similar in wake and N1. In wake, N1 and N3, microstate map C was most dominant w.r.t. global explained variance and temporal presence (ratio total time), whereas in N2 microstate map B was most prominent. In N3, the mean duration of all microstate maps increased significantly, expressed also as an increase in transition probabilities of all maps to themselves in N3. This duration increase was partly—but not entirely—explained by the occurrence of slow waves in the EEG. The persistence of exactly four main microstate classes in all NREM sleep stages might speak in favor of an in principle maintained large scale spatial brain organization from wakeful rest to NREM sleep. In N1 and N3 sleep, despite spectral EEG differences, the microstate maps and characteristics were surprisingly close to wakefulness. This supports the notion that EEG microstates might reflect a large scale resting state network architecture similar to preserved fMRI resting state connectivity. We speculate that the incisive functional alterations which can be observed during the transition to deep sleep might be driven by changes in the level and timing of activity within this architecture.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES To compare the relative effects on performance of sleep deprivation and alcohol.
METHODS Performance effects were studied in the same subjects over a period of 28 hours of sleep deprivation and after measured doses of alcohol up to about 0.1\% blood alcohol concentration (BAC). There were 39 subjects, 30 employees from the transport industry and nine from the army.
RESULTS After 17–19 hours without sleep, corresponding to 2230 and 0100, performance on some tests was equivalent or worse than that at a BAC of 0.05\%. Response speeds were up to 50\% slower for some tests and accuracy measures were significantly poorer than at this level of alcohol. After longer periods without sleep, performance reached levels equivalent to the maximum alcohol dose given to subjects (BAC of 0.1\%).
CONCLUSIONS These findings reinforce the evidence that the fatigue of sleep deprivation is an important factor likely to compromise performance of speed and accuracy of the kind needed for safety on the road and in other industrial settings.},
