### Outline:

1. **Summary / Synopsis**

2. **Introduction to the problem**
   
   1. General Research about Problem

Safety is the most essential priority while driving. Drowsiness on the wheel however,  endangers both drivers and pedestrians and is  among the leading causes for car accidents. About 17% of fatal traffic accidents are estimated to be due to tiredness (AAA, 2010) which results in an estimated yearly cost of $43.15 - $56.02 billions in the United States alone (Leger, 1994). 

Additionally, drowsiness has been demonstrated to severely impair driving performance. On average, tired drivers perform worse than alcohol-intoxicated individuals with blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% (Williamson et al., 2000). 
   
   2. Relating Back to industry (Loss to Stakeholders)

Predicting dangerous levels of tiredness and preventing vehicle crashes or accidents offer a business opportunity to produce safer vehicles, decrease insurance costs as well as possibly saving lives. 

The automotive industry has reacted to the drowsiness problem by introducing drowsiness-detection systems. These systems consider  four main categories of patterns: steering, vehicle-to-lane, face and physiological patterns. 
   
   3. Problem Statement 

These patterns and their effectiveness in detecting drowsiness will be considered in this paper.

---- Text that can be useful but likely unusable ---- 

Tiredness on the wheel is the cause of TODO number of accidents every year and endangers the lives of both drivers and pedestrians (TODO: Add citation). 

Since the past years, the automotive industry has attempted to tackle this issue with drowsiness-detection systems that have been embedded in vehicles. These systems are however outdated, and recent advances in machine learning have allowed the detection of more complex and personalized patterns of tiredness. 

Osmitau Technologies **delivers** Teyered, an adaptable drowsiness-detection systems that uses state-of-the-art techniques to prevent road accidents. 

This offers an opportunity to provide customers with safer vehicles 

Teyered combines different sources of inputs, learns new patterns and adapts to the driver.
