# WP01 - Build UTA-RLDD Dataset 

Loops through the UTA-RLDD videos and runs `process_videos` thus extracting the
 eye closedness over time. Each output file will be named `{Person ID}_
 {Label}.csv`

## Steps to reproduce
- Place the contents of zip files to be in the folder `tiredness-analysis
/video/` 
- Run `work_products/WP01/run.sh`
